A web based multi-user application which would facilitate users managing their passwords for multiple websites,
this applications allows them to store passwords in encrypted form with multiple hints. The application would initially
would have multiple hints stored for each password which would allow users to identify their passwords for various sites.

The password creation is categorized on the basis of what type it is, be it a bank account or website. There is a
miscellaneous category for ones which do not fall in either of the above two categories.

Users can also generate a random password based on level of security, a high level security would generate a 20 character
password with strong blend of block letters and numbers.

file. The file would be stored in encrypted form. Work on file decryption is still in progress.
